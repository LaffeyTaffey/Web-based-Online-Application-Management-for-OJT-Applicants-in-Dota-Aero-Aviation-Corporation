<h4><p align="center">JS files</p></h4>

```ruby
server.js

This script is an `Express.js` application. Its purpose is to serve static files, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, and handle HTTP requests.

Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

- **Dependencies:** The script requires several dependencies, including `Express.js` for creating the server, `path` for working with file paths, `body-parser` for parsing incoming request bodies, and `knex` (although it's not used in this script).

- **Express Server Setup:** It creates an instance of the `Express` application.

- **Middleware Setup:** It uses `body-parser` middleware to parse incoming JSON requests.

- **Routing:**
  - It defines a route for the root path `'/'` using `appExpress.get()`, which sends the `landing.html` file when someone accesses the root URL.
  - It serves static files (such as CSS, images, and JavaScript files) using `express.static()` middleware.
  - It defines a fallback route using `appExpress.use()` to handle 404 errors, sending the `404.html` file when a requested resource is not found.

- **Server Listening:** It starts the server and listens on port 3000. When the server is running, it logs a message indicating that it's listening on port 3000.

Overall, the purpose of this script is to create a basic web server using `Express.js`, serve static files, and handle HTTP requests.
```

```ruby
academics.js

This js code ssets up an event listener on an element with the class taskbar. 

-When the taskbar is clicked, it toggles the bottom style of an element with the class startmenu. 
-Specifically, if the startmenu's bottom style is currently "50px", it changes it to "-650px", and if it's not "50px", it sets it to "50px". 
-This effectively shows or hides the startmenu by moving it up or down based on its bottom position.
```

```ruby
admin.js

This code is responsible for setting up event listeners and populating data in notes weather data and more

-Once the event is triggered, it sets a timeout of 500 milliseconds and then executes a function. 

-Inside the function, it selects all elements with the class 'fade-in' using the querySelectorAll method. 

-It then loops through each element and adds the 'fade-in' class to it.
```

```ruby
jquery-3.1.1.min.js & jquery-3.7.1.min.js


The main purpose of jQuery.js is to simplify client-side scripting in HTML. jQuery is a fast, lightweight, and feature-rich JavaScript library that provides a variety of functions and utilities to make it easier to traverse and manipulate the HTML DOM (Document Object Model), handle events, perform animations, and make AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) requests.

Key purposes and features of jQuery.js:

-DOM Manipulation: jQuery simplifies DOM manipulation by providing methods to select HTML elements using CSS-style selectors and then perform various operations on them, such as adding, removing, or modifying attributes, content, or styles.

-Event Handling: jQuery facilitates event handling by providing methods to attach event handlers to HTML elements, such as click, hover, submit, etc. It also provides shorthand methods to trigger events and prevent default behavior.

-AJAX: jQuery simplifies making AJAX requests to the server using its $.ajax() method or higher-level shorthand methods like $.get() and $.post(). This enables developers to fetch data from the server asynchronously without reloading the entire web page.

-Animation: jQuery includes methods to create smooth animations and effects on HTML elements, such as fading in/out, sliding up/down, and toggling visibility. These methods help in enhancing the user experience by adding dynamic and interactive elements to the web page.

-Utilities: jQuery provides various utility functions and plugins to handle common tasks efficiently, such as manipulating arrays and objects, working with strings, handling browser compatibility issues, and more.

-Chaining: jQuery supports method chaining, allowing developers to perform multiple operations on the same set of elements in a single statement. This leads to cleaner and more concise code.

```ruby
ojt-adm-results.js

Is responsible for toggling the visibility of a search input field within a search wrapper. 
Here's a breakdown of its main functionality:

Parameters:
-obj: Represents the element that triggered the event.

-evt: Represents the event object (e.g., a click event).

Functionality:
-The function starts by finding the closest .search-wrapper container element relative to the obj.

-If the container does not have the class active, it adds the class active to make the search input visible and prevents the default behavior of the event (evt.preventDefault()).

-If the container already has the class active and the clicked element is not within the .input-holder (indicating that the user clicked outside the search input), it removes the active class from the container, hiding the search input.

-Additionally, if the search input is being hidden, it clears the input value by selecting the .search-input element within the container and setting its value to an empty string.
```

```ruby
ojt-requirements.js


This JavaScript code snippet controls a multi-step form with animation effects between steps. It validates user input and handles the transition between steps smoothly. 
Here's a breakdown of its main functionality:

Validation and Next Step:
-On clicking the "Next" button in the first step ($(".fs_next_btn")), it checks if the checkbox for consent is checked. If not, it displays an alert and sets the error flag to true.
-If there are no errors, it proceeds to the next step by calling the performAnimation() function.

Animation Function (performAnimation()):
-This function handles the animation between steps.
-It calculates the scale, left position, and opacity for the current and next slides.
-Animates the transition between slides using CSS properties like transform, opacity, and left.
After completing the animation, it hides the current slide and resets the animation flag.

Next Step:=
-On clicking the "Next" button in the second step ($(".ss_next_btn")), it calls the performAnimation() function to proceed to the next step.
Previous Step:

-On clicking the "Previous" button ($(".previous")), it handles the animation to move back to the previous step in a similar manner to the next step but in reverse.
```

```ruby
